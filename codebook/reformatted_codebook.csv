Thank you very much for participating in our final survey. Your participation in this phase of this study is now complete.
 
Before we end our visit today, we’d like to ask your permission to include the photograph you provided as part of this study into a database to be used in future research. Our research team would like to use computers to view and analyze photographs. As an example, we want to see if a computer can estimate when a person was born based just on their photograph. This is done confidentially, so the computer analyzing the photo does not know who you are.
 
If you provide your permission, please know your actual photograph will never be associated with your name or identifying information that you have provided to us in any public data; we will not share your photograph with anyone outside of our research team.  In addition, it would never be used publicly, and we would take the same security precautions we take to safeguard the data collected in the study you have completed. This means your photograph would remain in secure computers and only our research team would be able to access it through a password.
 
Please remember that providing permission to add your photograph to this database is completely voluntary and choosing not to provide consent will not affect your participation in other studies with our research team in the future.
